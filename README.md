# Bikesharing-Project

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this challenge is to help kate, create a presentation that will convince an investor who will invest in a bike sharing program ( DM BikeShare ) in Des Moines, Iowa,  similar to similar program in New York City named CitiBike.  This program will not offer just a cheaper and more relaxed way to travel around the city but give people a more eco-friendly option to reach their destination.
In order to fulfill this project, we are going to create some visualizations using Tableau which will help Kate demonstrate the most important points to talk about during a presentation.

## Results

We used the data to create 7 different visualizations to help evaluate, describe and and present DM BikeShare.

1.![Check out Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755329-8b4d4e04-28d4-4395-86c8-59c410ff78a4.png)

During this visualization, we are able to show the time break used for checking out all bikes for the riders. 	

2. ![Checkout Times by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755378-d1ab647b-47a6-4714-8f4b-711fbf022d9c.png)

In this visualization, we show the time break used for checking out all bikes for the riders according to their gender. 	

3. ![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755416-90a613d3-5d63-4ba4-a10c-cec338dd20cb.png)

In this visualization, we are able to show through a heatmap which is the most common hours during weekdays when riders use bikes the most.

4. ![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755435-bf0f0d06-385a-423c-80f2-427baa23dc0b.png)

This visualization, we demonstrated through a heatmap which is the most common hours during weekdays when riders, classifying them by their genders, use bikes the most.

5. ![Trips by Gender (Weekday )](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755446-6760e004-9f5e-4779-9204-e4d53c8aefc5.png)

This case, we create a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips according to gender and user type that riders have by each day of the week.

6. With this visualization, we are able to show through the density of color and size of the figure which are the most common places where riders start their bike trip. 

7. ing this visualization, on the contrary, we are able to show through the density of color and size of the figure which are the most common places where riders end their bike trip. 

## Summary

Finally, we have created two more data visualizations that can be of help to Kate in case she wants to use them. 

In this visualization, we show the birthdate and gender of riders so we can determine when which gender started using a bike and the distances they ride them.

This visualization, on the other hand, can be used to show investors which bikes have been used the most so they know when is almost the time to replace or repair them.
