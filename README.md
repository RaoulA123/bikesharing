# Bikesharing Project

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of this challenge is to help kate, create a presentation that will convince an investor who will invest in a bike sharing program ( DM BikeShare ) in Des Moines, Iowa,  similar to similar program in New York City named CitiBike.  This program will not offer just a cheaper and more relaxed way to travel around the city but give people a more eco-friendly option to reach their destination.

In order to fulfill this project, we are going to create some visualizations using Tableau which will help Kate demonstrate the most important points to talk about during a presentation.

## Results

We used the data to create 7 different visualizations to help evaluate, describe and present DM BikeShare.

1.![Check out Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755329-8b4d4e04-28d4-4395-86c8-59c410ff78a4.png)

This visualization helped show the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users.  	


2.![Checkout Times by Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755378-d1ab647b-47a6-4714-8f4b-711fbf022d9c.png)

In this visualization, we show the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users allocated by gender.



3. ![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755416-90a613d3-5d63-4ba4-a10c-cec338dd20cb.png)

In this visualization, we are able to show through a heatmap which is the most common hours during weekdays when riders use bikes the most.


4. ![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755435-bf0f0d06-385a-423c-80f2-427baa23dc0b.png)

This visualization, we demonstrated through a heatmap which is the most common hours during weekdays when riders, classifying them by their genders, use bikes the most.


5. ![Trips by Gender (Weekday )](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230755446-6760e004-9f5e-4779-9204-e4d53c8aefc5.png)

This case, we create a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips according to gender and user type that riders have by each day of the week.

6. ![Top Starting Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230756369-cd7c0652-295a-4a55-89bf-876f4b0afd36.png)

With this visualization, we determine the most active zone where bikes are picked up. This should inform Kate for find similar area in Des Moines. 

![Top Ending Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115424156/230756362-5ef8bf0a-a492-45be-9080-de109d6c20b8.png)

7. In this visualiztion, we determined the top end points for bike rides. Similar , to the point indicated above, Kate should investigate further and detrmine why these are the top destinations and either replicate that in Des Moines or evalaute if this might present an other investement opportunity. ske trip. 

## Summary
Through this project, we provided in visual ways, how Kate can convince the investor to fund her project. Since NYC is used as the model here, it should be determined why more bikes are picked up in one area as opposed to another. Similarly, why are bikes dropped off more in an area vis-a-vis another. These should inform Kate as to any secondary factor that would help her business become succesful ( if she receives the investement) as well help determine is there are other investment opportunities since through this project she has been able to indirectly calculate consummer availability ( consumer traffic) in various areas.
